# rubeGoldbergGame

With this project I've created my first fully-functional mulit-platform high-immersion VR game. 
The basic idea is to realize a rube goldber game, to get used to working with VR SDKs and to get familiarized with coding
core VR mechanics such as locomotion, grabbin and physics, scene loadeing and creating menu systems.
The idea behind a rube goldberg game is to realize a series of simple sequences that are linked together to produce a domino effect, in which each sequence triggers the next one, 
and the original goal is achieved only after many steps.
Fore more detailed information have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine.

1) Created Repository on GitHub
2) Download Starter Project and copied Assets and Projectsettings into rubeGoldbergGame
3) Testing project runs without erros (seeing factory environment)
4) Import of SteamVR Plugin following the tutorial of Kristin Dragos (important, the tutorial mirrors not the current version version the SteamVR Plugin, requires that SteamVR is running, otherwise error in console)
5) Testing project runs without errors
